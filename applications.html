<h2>What does the Future Hold?</h2>

<ul>
<li> The analyst firm Gartner predicts that by 2020 we can expect there to be over 26 billion 
connected devices. Any device that is capable of being connected will be connected. </li><br>
<li> Ciscoâ€™s CEO, John Chambers, has boldly proclaimed that there will be 50 billion 
devices online within five years, with a total market worth $19 trillion</li><br>	
<li> We can expect to see machines embedded with sensors that gather, store and analyze data. Each device will
be able to upload that data for further processing and download updated software.</li><br>
<li> With these technological advances comes legal/ethical issues. The first big issue we face is the ownership of this data.
Does the data collected by your devices belong to you or the company who manufactured the device? We also have to look at this 
through a privacy perspective, should law enforcement be able to access vehicle data in a criminal investigation? These are all issues we'll need to
address as devices become more connected.</li>
